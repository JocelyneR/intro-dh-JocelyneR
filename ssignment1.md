Billboard’s Greatest Songs of All Time

	Using data collected from Billboard’s ‘Greatest Songs of All Time’ I researched and gathered information regarding the individual songs from the list using Wikipedia. My research was guided by the humanities topics of anthropology and sociology. Popular music reflects many social trends, which I was trying to investigate. Data regarding music does not only reflect a cultural aspect of society through time but also changes in ideas, styles, and influences. Popular singers have the ability to influence people through both musical styles and ideas. Recently, through the rise of technology, there has been an increasing number of international songs making their way into the American charts. By gathering more information on ‘the greatest songs of all time’ I attempt to look for a trend in the American music industry regarding the influence of international singers as well as who these singers are. Furthermore, as it is widely known, American culture often influences international cultures as well; therefore, by analyzing the ‘greatest songs of all time’ I attempt to find which songs have had the greatest overall global influence in the music industry. 

	Furthermore, his data could be used to answer multiple questions both for academic and practical use. This data includes information regarding general trends in the music industry that could answer questions such as who is (or has been popular), what trends do popular songs have in common, music and music styles evolution through time, as well as who and what time period has had the greatest impact in popular culture. Also, as mentioned before, the songs in the list do not include only songs that were popular within the United States, but the list also takes into consideration international rankings. This means that this data does not only represent the songs that have had the greatest influence within American popular culture but have also influenced people across the world.
