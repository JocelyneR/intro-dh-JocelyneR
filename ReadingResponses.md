### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
AHA!: "The trouble is that Moretti isn’t studying a science. Literature is an artificial universe, and the written word, unlike the natural world, can’t be counted on to obey a set of laws"- This sentence points out one of the main problems with analyzing literature and art merely through statistics or distant reading without the proper context.

Confusing: "You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small"- Although I understand Moretti's argument, he undermines the importance of specific knowledge over generalized knowledge. Is knowing little about many things better than knowing much about few things?




### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
AHA!: "One way to think about how the process of topic modeling works is to imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them."- This is a good way to think visualize how topic modeling works

Confusing: "Topic modeling is not necessarily useful as evidence but it makes an excellent tool for discovery."- It seems a little contradictory that although topic modeling is a good tool for discovery it cannot be necessarily useful as evidence. I understanding this to mean that topic modeling is not always exact and that is why it cannot always be used as evidence; yet, this is a feature of most evidence in the humanities and social sciences.
